# format.swift

> Format all the things

# format-only.swift

> Select certain SwiftFormat rule to format with

This is a convenient script to run both Swiftformat and Swiftlint.

## Setting up

`brew install fd` (a super-performant Rust version of find)

## Usage

## Customizing for your needs

This script is just a starting point for your own projects. Feel free to choose your own rules and configurations! Also, I recommend managing Swiftlint and Swiftformat versions because new rules appear often. One solution is [Mint](mint-url....)

## TODO

- [ ] Add --help/-h arguments
